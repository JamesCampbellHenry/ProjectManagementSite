# ProjectManagementSite
 When you want to make changes to the project, do not push your version to the master branch.
 create a new branch and push it to that and wait for me to respond.
 After that i can make a Pull request that will merge the two versions together, this prevents any over-lapping and errors happening
 to the master copy, ensures we dont loose anything important.
 This also achrives the branch changes you made so we can see the different version.


# NOTES FOR MAKING PHP PAGES
we should be doing all our testing and front end development in the HTML files first, once they are done, copy the content you've changed into the PHP version of the page.


# Sprint Two TODO
we have our basic pages setup, but we need to add more content to them with more functionality options for the users. i also want to implement a "news" page which will be a kind of blog style page where staff and students can post updates on events, separate from the events page, i think this will be a good and easier way to view changes/info on the events other than having them updates in the database all the time, only staff should be able to change events, students and staff can both post updates thouh on the news page, i hope that makes sense.

# EVENTS PAGE (Mark)
I'm down to take on the events page myself, this sprint ill be adding modals, which will display when the event is clicked, showing more detailed information about the event. i will also be testing out some "event type" sections and colour coding for the buildings. so leave all that to me :)

# STAFF MANAGEMENT PAGE (Sean)
we currently only have a form to add staff, which is a great starting point. I think we should add a list of current staff, which also has clickable modals which will allow staff/super user to edit the info of the staff (use an input form in the modal pop up). We should section this page out more, implement columns to separate the content across the page. I'll implement a basic template for you to work off of and comment accordingly.

# EVENTS MANAGEMENT PAGE (Joe)
Same as the staff page, we only have a form right now. We should add a list, similar to the events page which displays the events in a shorter and easier way to view on the same page, the events list can be clicked and edited from the manage events page, we want all of the users options available to them on the same page. This events list will be clickable and display models with editable event information (use an input form in the modal pop up) I'll implement a basic template for you to work off of and comment accordingly.

# NEWS PAGE & IMAGES (James)
I think we should have a page where news and fast updates can be posted without making any big changes to the events page or the database, in the similar style to a blog, both students and staff can post small opdates here that arn't important enough to change the even i'll implement a basic template and some placeholders for you to work from. For the images on the homepage, whenever you have them ready let me (mark) know and we'll pick ones to put in, the codes a bit jail and its display is based on the image's res
