# ProjectManagementSite
Please remeber to create a new branch when you're making your changes, don't push changes directly to the master or fork the repo, having branches makes it a lot easier for me to manage and avoid any merge conflicts.

# Sprint Two TODO
we have our basic pages setup, but we need to add more content to them with more functionality options for the users. i also want to implement a "news" page which will be a kind of blog style page where staff and students can post updates on events, separate from the events page, i think this will be a good and easier way to view changes/info on the events other than having them updates in the database all the time, only staff should be able to change events, students and staff can both post updates thouh on the news page, i hope that makes sense.

EVENTS PAGE (Mark)
I'm down to take on the events page myself, this sprint ill be adding modals, which will display when the event is clicked, showing more detailed information about the event. i will also be testing out some "event type" sections and colour coding for the buildings. so leave all that to me :)

STAFF MANAGEMENT PAGE (Sean)
we currently only have a form to add staff, which is a great starting point. I think we should add a list of current staff, which also has clickable modals which will allow staff/super user to edit the info of the staff. We should section this page out more, implement columns to separate the content across the page. I'll implement a basic template for you to work off of and comment accordingly.

EVENTS MANAGEMENT PAGE (Joe)
Same as the staff page, we only have a form right now. We should add a list, similar to the events page which displays the events in a shorter and easier way to view on the same page, these can be clicked and edited from the manage events page, we want all of the users options available to them on the same page. I'll implement a basic template for you to work off of and comment accordingly.

NEWS PAGE (James)
I think we should have a page where news and fast updates can be posted without making any big changes to the events page or the database, in the similar style to a blog, both students and staff can post here, but only selected students and all added staff should be able to add events in the events manager.
